# Big-Number
INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTER 1 in NCU
- Introduction: We know that an integer number has 32 bits, so even using unsigned integer can only represent the maximum value of 2^32-1. Thus, we need to apply "Big Number" to solve this problem.

- Description: The program was implemented by the concept of Arithmetic Unit in Hardware.  <br />
 The difference between the code and Arithmetic Unit is that the former computes numbers in Decimal and the latter in Binary.

- Adder Unit:
> carry in	9  <br /> 
> input 0	9  <br />
> input 1	9  <br />
> <p>&nbsp</p> ----------- <br />
> output       	7  <br />
> carry out	2  <br />
